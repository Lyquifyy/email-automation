# Local AI Email Summarizer (Powered by Ollama)

This project is a **local-running AI Agent** that connects to your Gmail inbox, fetches emails from the past week, and generates a **clear and organized summary** using a local **Ollama LLM model** (like `llama3.2`).

Itâ€™s built for **privacy, automation, and simplicity** â€” all data is processed locally, and no external AI APIs are used.

1. The script authenticates with Gmail using OAuth2 (Google API).
2. It retrieves all emails from the past 7 days.
3. Email content (subject, sender, body) is extracted and cleaned.
4. The emails are structured and sent to a **local Ollama model** for summarization.
5. The AI returns a concise summary that you can print, log, or email to yourself.
